# SmartBox
***
## Overview
SmartBox is a Component-Container framework designed to streamline the development and operation of modular applications. By allowing users to load pre-defined components into a dynamic running container, SmartBox facilitates the integration and interaction of disparate functionalities smoothly.

***
### Key Features
- **Dynamic Component Loading:** Easily add or remove components at runtime, enhancing flexibility in application development.
- **Interface-Based Communication:** Components communicate through defined interfaces, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and modularity.
- **Reflection Utilization:** Leverages Java reflection to dynamically handle components, promoting extensibility and scalability.
- **MVC Architecture:** Implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate the application's concerns and improve maintainability.

***
### Components
- **Container:** The core component that holds and manages all other components, facilitating their interaction.
- **Component:** Abstract base for all components within the system, holding the logic to interact within the Container.
- **ICalculator, StatsCalculator, Calculator:** Example components demonstrating how individual functionalities can be implemented and integrated.
